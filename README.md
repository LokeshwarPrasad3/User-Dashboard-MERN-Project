## Description

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application development project. It aims to create a user dashboard with different account types. Users can create an account by providing their name, email, phone number, work profile, and profile image. After logging in with their email and password, users have access to three main menus: Home, About, and Contact.

- Home: Displays the user's name.
- About: Displays all the user's information, including images and additional details and you can modified them.
- Contact: Provides the user's contact details and a message form.

The web app is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience. It is responsive, with an attractive design, appealing fonts, CSS styles, and suitable images.
